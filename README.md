# NYCTaxiTripDurationPredict

The first goal of this project is to use the New York city yellow taxi dataset to explore the potential information leakage.

The second goal of this project is to build a prediction model based on the given dataset to predict trip duration within the rush hour time period (17:00:00 â€“ 19:59:59).

The original dataset spans 8,713,831 taxi trips in June 2018. After being extracted, the data within the rush hours still has 1,547,759 taxi trip records.

Was required to finish the project in 72 hours.
